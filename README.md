# Code-Quiz-HW4

## Description

This project was built to further my javascript knowledge and providing me a small study tool for common terms within javascript. I learned that you can sort through an array with multiple layers of objects and can call multiple functions within functions. Also, I learned that I can use javascript to add to the HTML file, including dynamically displaying objects from the local storage.

## Usage

To use, simply copy and paste the github url into the browser https://jdellis490.github.io/Code-Quiz-HW4/
